    "# Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a particularly powerful and flexible class of supervised algorithms for both classification and regression. Suppor Vector Machine is highly preferred by many as it produces significant accuracy with less computation power. In this section, we will develop the intuition behind support vector machines and their use in classification problems.\n",

    "## What is Support Vector Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (N - the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='files/img/hyperplane.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e. the maximum distance between data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.\n",

    "## Hyperplanes and Support Vectors\n",

    "\n",
    "Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceed 3.\n",
