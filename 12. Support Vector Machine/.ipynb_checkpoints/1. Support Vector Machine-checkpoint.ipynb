    "# Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a particularly powerful and flexible class of supervised algorithms for both classification and regression. Suppor Vector Machine is highly preferred by many as it produces significant accuracy with less computation power. In this section, we will develop the intuition behind support vector machines and their use in classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Support Vector Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (N - the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='files/img/hyperplane.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e. the maximum distance between data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperplanes and Support Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='files/img/hyperplane3d.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceed 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='files/img/supportvectors.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These are the points that help us build our SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The primal form\n",
    "\n",
    "A support vector classifier can be represented mathematically by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = w^T x - b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "using the output $f(x)$ to determine the class label vector $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    y =\n",
    "    \\begin{cases}\n",
    "        1, & f(x) \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "        -1, & f(x) < 0\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is a feature vector, $w$ is a weight vector, and $b$ is a bias term. For SVMs, the convention is to use class labels $y \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$. This function $f(x)$ represents the classifier's decision function. It looks similar to the problem posed by logistic regression, however with an SVM we don't want just any solution that will divide our data, we want the solution that will do so with the largest margin between our two classes (if possible). This introduces a constraint to our problem. What this ultimately means is that our optimization problem becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$min_{w, b} \\frac{||w||^2}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y^{(i)}(w^T x^{(i)} - b) \\geq 1, i = 1,...,m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the number of training examples, indexed by $i$. This formulation is known as the [primal formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Primal_form) of the SVM optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation can be solved using existing quadratic programming solvers such as [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) and other methods (for example see [this paper [PDF]](http://is.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/neco_%5B0%5D.pdf). However, there is another formulation of the problem that can be solved without using quadratic programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dual form\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Lagrange duality, the optimization problem can be reformulated into the [dual form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Dual_form) (see [lecture notes for Stanford's CS229 taught by Andrew Ng](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html) for a walkthrough of the math if you're interested).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$max_{\\alpha}W(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i, j = 1}^m y^{(i)}y^{(j)}\\alpha_i \\alpha_j \\langle x^{(i)}, x^{(j)} \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is also subject to the following two constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq C, i = 1,...,m$$\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i y^{(i)} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "-  $m$ is the number of training examples\n",
    "-  $x^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ training example feature vector\n",
    "-  $\\langle x^{(i)}, x^{(j)} \\rangle$ represents the inner product of the $x^{(i)}$ and $x^{(j)}$ feature vectors\n",
    "-  $y^{(i)}$ is the class for the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "-  $\\alpha_i$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "-  $C$ is a regularization parameter (larger values introduce less regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a kernel $K(x, z)$, with feature mapping function $\\phi(x)$, $\\langle x^{(i)}, x^{(j)} \\rangle$ is replaced with $\\langle \\phi(x^{(i)}), \\phi(x^{(j)})\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the dual form, the SVM decision function is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i y^{(i)} \\langle x^{(i)}, x \\rangle + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $b$ is a scalar bias term we will calculate when training our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of understanding the concepts behind support vector classification, we will instead implement a version of the [Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_minimal_optimization) algorithm as described by [John Platt in 1998 [PDF]](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69644/tr-98-14.pdf) to solve our optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMO works by breaking down the dual form of the SVM optimization problem into many smaller optimization problems that are more easily solvable. In a nutshell, the algorithm works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Two multiplier values ($\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_j$) are selected out and their values are optimized while holding all other $\\alpha$ values constant.\n",
    "-  Once these two are optimized, another two are chosen and optimized over.\n",
    "-  Choosing and optimizing repeats until the convergence, which is determined based on the problem constraints. Heuristics are used to select the two $\\alpha$ values to optimize over, helping to speed up convergence. The heuristics are based on error cache that is stored while training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're looking for\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want out of the algorithm is a vector of $\\alpha$ values that are mostly zeros, except where the corresponding training example is closest to the decision boundary. These examples are our support vectors and should lie near the decision boundary. We should end up with a few of them once our algorithm has converged. What this implies is that the resultant decision boundary will only depend on the training examples closest to it. If we were to add more examples to our training set that were far from the decision boundary, the support vectors would not change. However, labeled examples closer to the decision boundary can exert greater influence on the solution, subject to the degree of regularization. In other words, non-regularized (hard-margin) SVMs can be sensitive to outliers, while regularized (soft-margin) models are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "__Goal:__ Implement a two-class SVC that is able to make use of the kernel trick. Use SMO to solve the SVM optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will use [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) to handle our arrays, [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to visualize our data and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) to generate some toy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: This notebook was written with Python 3.5, which has the `@` operator, an infix matrix multiplication operator. If you're using a version of Python that is earlier than 3.5, you will need to replace operations like `X @ Y` with `np.dot(X, Y)`."

    "### Kernels\n",

This kernel calculates a Gaussian similarity between the training examples listed in $x$ and $z$, with a value of 1 indicating that the points have exactly the same feature vector and 0 indicating dissimilar vectors. Using this kernel allows for the construction of more complex, non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these functions should take two array of features and return a matrix of shape length $x$ by length $z$. SVMs can make use of many different kernels without any change in the code to train them, as long as the Gram matrix output by the kernel is positive, semi-definite (see these [lecture notes [PDF]](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2011fa/lecture/08-svm_kernels.pdf) for more information).\n",
