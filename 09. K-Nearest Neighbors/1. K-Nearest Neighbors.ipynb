    "# k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (or kNN for short) is an easy algorithm to understand and to implement, and a powerful tool to have at your disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will implement the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch in Python. The implementation will be specific for classification problems and will be demonstrated using the Iris flowers classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is for you if you are a Python programmer, or a programmer who can pick-up Python quickly, and you are interested in how to implement k-Nearest Neighbors from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/k-Nearest-Neighbors-algorithm.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The model for kNN is the entire training dataset. When a prediction is required for an unseen data instance, the kNN algorithm will search through the training dataset for the k-most similar instances. The prediction attribute of the most similar instances is summarized and returned as the prediction for the unseen instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity measure is dependent on the type of data. For real-valued data, the Euclidean distance can be used. Other types of data such as categorical or binary data, Hamming distance can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of regression problems, the average of the predicted attribute may be returned. In the case of classification, the most prevalent class may be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does k-Nearest Neighbors Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The kNN algorithm belongs to the family of instance-based, competitive learning and lazy learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-based algorithms are those algorithms that model the problem using data instances (or rows) in order to make predictive decisions. The kNN algorithm is an extreme form of instance-based methods because all training observations are retained as part of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a competitive learning algorithm, because it internally uses competition between model elements (data instances) in order to make a predictive decision. The objective similarity measure between data instances causes each data instance to compete to \"win\" or be most similar to a given unseen data instance and contribute to a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy learning refers to the fact that the algorithm does not build a model until the time that a prediction is required. It is lazy because it only does work at the last second. This has the benefit of only including data relevant to the unseen data, called a localized model. A disadvantage is that it can be computationally expensive to repeat the same or similar searches over larger training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, kNN is powerful because it does not assume anything about the data, other than a distance measure that can be calculated consistently between any two instances. As such, it is called non-parametric or non-linear as it does not assume a functional form\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classify Flowers Using Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The test problem we will be using in this tutorial is iris classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species. There are 4 measurements of given flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, all in the same unit of centimeters. The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of setosa, versicolor or virginica.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a standard dataset where the species is known for all instances. As such we can split the data into training and test datasets and use the results to evaluate our algorithm implementation. Good classification accuracy on this problem is above 90% correct, typically 96% or better.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section provides you with ideas for extensions that you could apply and investigate with the Python code you have implemented as part of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  __Regression__: You could adapt the implementation to work for regression problems (predicting a real-valued attribute). The summarization of the closest instances could involve taking the mean or the median of the predicted attribute.\n",
    "-  __Normalization__: When the units of measure differ between attributes, it is possible for attributes to dominate in their contribution to the distance measure. For these types of problems, you will want to rescale all data attributes into the range 0-1 (called normalization) before calculating similarity. Update the model to support data normalization.\n",
    "-  __Alternative Distance Measure__: There are many distance measures available, and you can even develop your own domain-specific distance measures if you like. Implement an alternative distance measure, such as Manhattan distance or the vector dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more extensions to this algorithm you might like to explore. Two additional ideas include support for distance-weighted contribution for the k-most similar instances to the prediction and more advanced data tree-based structures for searching for similar instances."
