    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on the __Bayes' Theorem__.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $A$ and $B$ are events and $P(B) \\neq 0$.\n",
    "-  $P(A|B)$ is a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $A$ occurring given that $B$ is true.\n",
    "-  $P(B|A)$ is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $B$ occurring given that $A$ is true.\n",
    "-  $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of observing $A$ and $B$ independently of each other; this is known as the marginal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a single algorithms but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. This is a strong assumption but results in a fast and effective method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a class value given a value of an attribute is called the conditional probability. By multiplying the conditional probabilities together for each attribute for a given class value, we have a probability of a data instance belonging to that class.\n",

    "To make a prediction we can calculate probabilities of the instance belonging to each class and select the class value with the highest probability.\n",

All attributes are numeric, and their units vary from attribute to attribute.\n",

    "-  __Calculate Class Probabilities__: Update the example to summarize the probabilities of a data instance belonging to each class as a ratio. This can be calculated as the probability of a data instance belonging to one class, divided by the sum of the probabilities of the data instance belonging to each class. For example, an instance had the probability of 0.02 for class A and 0.001 for class B, the likelihood of the instance belonging to class A is 0.02/(0.02 + 0.001) * 100 which is about 95.23%.\n",
    "-  __Log Probabilities__: The conditional probabilities for each class given an attribute value are small. When they are multiplied together, they result in very small values, which can lead to floating point underflow (numbers are too small to represent in Python). A common fix for this is to combine the log of the probabilities together. Research and implement this improvement.\n",
    "-  __Nominal Attributes__: Update the implementation to support nominal attributes. This is much similar and the summary information you can collect for each attribute is the ratio of category values for each class.\n",
    "-  __Different Density Function__ (_bernoulli_ or _multinomial_): We have looked at Gaussian Naive Bayes, but you can also look at other distributions. Implement a different distribution such as _multinomial_, _bernoulli_ or _kernel naive bayes_ that make different assumptions about the distribution of attribute values and/or their relationship with the class value."
